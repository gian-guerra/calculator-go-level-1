# Calculator - Golang level 1

In this calculator we're using the next level of golan knowledge that includes:
 - Structs (fields, methods, constructors)
 - Methods on structs (value vs pointer receivers)
 - Interfaces (duck typing, implementation without keywords)
 - Interface composition (e.g. io.Reader)
 - Empty interface (interface{}) and type assertions
 - Embedding (code reuse via composition)
